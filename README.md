## Overview
The **Laptop Price Prediction** project aims to predict laptop prices based on various specifications such as processor, RAM, storage, and other features. This project utilizes machine learning models, including **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, to make accurate price predictions. A **Streamlit** web application is developed to provide an interactive interface for users to input laptop specifications and get price predictions.

## Features
- Train and evaluate **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models
- User-friendly **Streamlit** web application for predictions
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for better accuracy
- Visualizations to understand dataset insights

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Streamlit


## Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nishant43S/Laptop-price-prediction.git
cd laptop-price-prediction
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit Web App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
1. Open the Streamlit web app.
2. Enter laptop specifications in the input fields.
3. Click the **Predict Price** button to get the estimated price.

## Model Training
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature scaling.
- **Training**: Trained both Random Forest and XGBoost models.
- **Evaluation**: Used RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score for model performance analysis.
